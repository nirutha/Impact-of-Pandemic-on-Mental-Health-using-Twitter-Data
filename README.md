# Impact of pandemic on mental health using twitter data


### The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of the pandemic on mental health and the different reasons of pandemic people are suffering.



### We perform data collection using the tweepy module, pre-processing of the tweet data and sentiment analysis using the textblob module for depression analysis.


### We train a model for processed tweets data using different classifiers to predict the tweets as depressed or non-depressed. The depressed tweets are used to further train a model to categorize into different groups based on the most common reasons of pandemic using clustering algorithms.


### The machine learning algorithms of classification and clustering are verified and evaluated based on corresponding metric methods for analysis. 


### Requirements:
 - Python 3.6.1 or Higher
 - Twitter developer account
 - A bunch of modules (Keras, TF, Numpy, Sklearn, Pandas, Itertools)
    


### Code folder contains the main script SMDM_Final_Project_Code.ipynb of the project


### Data folder contains csv files collected from twitter api for tweets data


### Input folder contains the oauth csv file which has tweets access token and secret and API access token and dictionary.tsv for sentiment analysis.


### Input folder also contains combined.csv file which is created by combining and consolidating all the collected tweets into a single csv


### Steps:
 - Create a twitter developer account and get token values for accessing the twitter API.
 - Import the required modules to create the environment.
 - Run data collection function in SMDM_Final_Project_Code.ipynb to obtain the tweets data.
 - Run pre-processing step to remove url, punctuations, stop words and tokenize the words with lemmatization and stemming.
 - Run the sentiment analysis step to classify the data into positive, negative and neutral tweets based on the depression dictionary called dictionary.tsv
 - Run the classification modeling step to predict the tweet data as depressed or non-depressed using Naive-bayes, logistic regression, Decision tree, random forest, svm and neural network classifiers. 
 - Run the evaluation step containing evaluateMyModels() function to analyze the performance metrics of each classifiers.
 - Run the Clustering step in the script for performing k-means clustering on the processed data with visualization of the clusters.
